# CatastroBuddy

CatastroBuddy is the prototype for a full-stack web app to easily submit records of household items to an insurance company before or after a catastrophe. Instead 
of going through the difficult process of collecting data on household items after a catastrophe, clients can use CatastroBuddy to complete the 
process without questions on what to submit to an adjuster or how to submit information. 

This app was built using [React](https://react.dev/) on the frontend. It calls a Flask REST API to save data on a MongoDB server.
